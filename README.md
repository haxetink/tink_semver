# Tinkerbell Semantic Versioning

This library aims to provide a clean implementation of a superset of SemVer 1 and a subset of SemVer 2. It does follow SemVer 2 by adding support for prerelease notation, however it is restricted to either `alpha`, `beta` or `rc` with an optional prerelease counter. This is the versioning permitted by haxelib.
